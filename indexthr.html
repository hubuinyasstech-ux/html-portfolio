        <p>I am a lecturer in the <span style="color: red;">Stanford</span> Computer Science Department. Before coming to <br> 
            <span style="color: red;">Stanford</span>, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At <br> Taligent, 
            I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed <br> to improve 
            communication and coordination within small project teams. 
            I was <br> fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product 
            throughout an entire <br> software lifecycle from initial product conception 
            through the actual product <br> launch.</p>
            <p>
               I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine,
                where I specialized in <br> Software Engineering. 
                My dissertation was on process support for software <br> engineering teams.
                 I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a <br> specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and
                  bachelors degrees in Computer <br> Science and Electrical Engineering. </p>

                   <div style="font-size: 16pt;"> 
                    <p>At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, 
                    and Software Processes, a <br> graduate seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor,
                     a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on <br> leadership for campus chapters of both
                      Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. </p>
